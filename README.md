# jshack-ip_filter
Blackboard Learn JavaScript Hack (https://github.com/AllTheDucks/jshack-v1) to customize the "Restrict Location" test setting

This JSHack does two things:

1. HIDES the "Custom Filter" setting so that Instructor's aren't tempted to make their own ALLOW/BLOCK IP Ranges
2. Puts some information on the screen, below the Restriction drop-down:

You can require students to take a test or survey in a specific location. Students outside of this location aren't able to take the test or survey. The default value is 'No restrictions'. Choose 'UA Campus Network' to require students to be logged in from the campus network IP range (130.184.*.*).

This text is customizable within the JSHack.
